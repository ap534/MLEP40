We will evaluate the systems offline through metrics like precision and recall to ensure we are confident in the community recommendations, and then the experiment will test the true downsteam impact of our recommendation system."

The experiment pool will recieve the community recommendation engine recommendations, while the control pool will get the defult experience without the new community recommendation engine giving them community recommendations. We can split the group by 50% during the experiment, stratified by any important demographic variables. We need to be careful dialing up the experiment to ensure we do not dial up functionality that may cause errors at scale. We also need to be rigorous in making sure the appropriate number of users we correctly trigger into the experiment, since discrepancies can lead to incorrect reuslts."
