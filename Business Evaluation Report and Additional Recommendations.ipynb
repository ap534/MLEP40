    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First, lets clarify the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The cost of storing a compressed movie is not given, we can assume movies are already stored compressed and uncompressed for fast access, so the $0.75/day cost is the full incremental cost of storing the uncompressed movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### In the worst case if a purchased movie is stored for 15 days without being watched, it would be at a cost of \\\\$0.75 per day * 15 days = \\\\$11.25 \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The subscription model means that subscribed users will be able to watch any movie in the catalog during their subscription period, while non-subscribed users would have to pay \\\\$5 for a movie rented or \\\\$12 for a monthly membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Business Income Stream\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's make some assumptions and evaluate to see how our recommendation system would perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Say we have the following as a reasonable lower bound baseline:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Active Users: 1,000 active users\n",
    "##### Number of Movies: 9,000 movies\n",
    "##### Monthly Active Users: 60% (600) of them are active monthly\n",
    "##### Purchases: 10% purchase movies each month, so about 60 purchases\n",
    "##### Rental Rate: 30% rent movies each month\n",
    "##### Subscription Rate: 20% subscribe to the service\n",
    "##### Number of Purchases per User: 2 per month\n",
    "##### Number of Rentals per User: 2 per month\n",
    "##### Probability that a user will click one of our recommendations: We will estimate this at about 1% based on our previous analysis. The cost of one click is then 100 * \\\\$0.01 = \\\\$1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Then we know that we get the following revenue\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rental Revenue\n",
    "##### 2 rentals / user * 600 active users * 0.3 = 360 rentals \n",
    "##### 360 rental * \\\\$5/month = \\\\$1800 from rentals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purchase Revenue\n",
    "##### 0.1 purchase / user * 600 active users = 60 purchases\n",
    "##### 60 purchases * \\\\$1 per purchase = \\\\$720 from purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subscription Revenue\n",
    "##### 20% subscribers / total users * 1000 total users = 200 subscriptions\n",
    "##### 200 * \\\\$20/subscription = \\\\$4000\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total revenue = \\\\$4000 + \\\\$720 + $\\$$1800 = \\\\$6520\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now we need to account for the expenses (excluding recommendations)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storage expenses for purchases\n",
    "##### Purchased movie will be put to storage after 15 days without being watched.\n",
    "##### If we assume 10% of movies are purchased and 50% are watched just once, then that gives 900 puchased movies * 15 * days * 0.5 watched * \\\\$0.75/day = \\\\$5062.5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storage expenses for rentals\n",
    "##### Rentals will be stored for a max of 3 days. Let's assume we need to store all rental movies for 3 days for the worst case.\n",
    "##### 30% rentals * 600 active users * 2 rentals/user * 3 days * \\\\$0.75/day = \\\\$810 in rental storage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total storage expenses = \\\\$810+\\\\$5062.5=\\\\$5872.5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If we heavily simplify and assume these are the only expenses for now, we get a profit of \\\\$6520-\\\\$5872.5=\\\\$647.5\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation Gain\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now with these simplifying assumptions in place, we can decide whether including our recommender makes sense for the business. If we assume our recommender has a hit rate @5 of 1%, we expect it to give a new rental or new purchase 1\\% of the time. 100 uses of our recommender costs 100 * 0.01 = \\\\$1, but a movie rental costs \\\\$5 and purchase costs \\\\$12, minus storage fees. Also our recommender will lead to more subscriptions and new subscriptions can bring in \\\\$20 a month to the business, minus expenses. We determined earlier that the storage costs usually are smaller than the user purchases with our simplifying assumptions, and getting more users to rent or buy movies would budge it even further in the driection of profit, give that we could save money on movies being put back from uncompression if we recommended them and they get watched or purchased, our system would potentially have a huge gain in terms of profit. Also there would be downstream impact that is not easily measured, such as building trust with the customer through good recommendations, and having new users onboard due to our recommendation feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### If we assume our 600 users recieved 10 recommendations each, it would be 6,000 recommendations in total and 60 additional actions (movie purchase, movie rental or subscrption). We could assume it's 30 rentals, 20 purchases and 10 subscrptions. We would have additional storage costs from our recommendations, we can they are similar to previously calculated costs, 20 purchases*0.5 unwatched*\\\\$11.25=\\\\$112.5 for unwanted movie purchases and 30*3*\\\\$0.75=\\\\$67.5 for rental storage costs.  Then we still get an incremental gain of 30*5 + 20*12 + 10*20 - 60 (additional recommendations cost) - 67.5 - 112.5 = \\\\$350.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to test\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To test our assumptions, we would want the business to run an A/B test and see the incremental gain for a pool of users that recieves the recommendation system. We would track the amount of movies rented, bought, watch time, frequency of usage, amount of subscriptions and see if they move in a statistically significant way based on whether or not users were inside our test pool."

    "## Additional Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To continue increasing profit, the business can begin to use machine learning or heuristics to predict when to delete the uncompressed version, instead of a hard 15 day limit they can potentially save a lot of money when they do not store uncompressed videos. They should consider continually A/B testing and improving the recommendation engine with new techniques and features to improve the hit rate, and ask for user feedback to ensure the system matches user expectations. Instead of just using content-based techniques, the business could use collaborative methods or even deep learning based methods to greatly improve the recommendations, and this would potentially increase the value of the system and delight customers while also making profit and giving a competitive edge over other services."
